 @abstract MOTabView extends NSTabView to add drag & drop support.
 @discussion MOTabView extends NSTabView to add drag & drop support.  The tab view's delegate can implement various new methods to support dragging of tabs and accepting drops.  As a drag source, MOTabView allows tabs to be dragged.  As a drag destination MOTabView supports drops either "onto" a tab or "between" tabs.  In both cases, it is left to the delegate to deal with the actual pasteboard content.
