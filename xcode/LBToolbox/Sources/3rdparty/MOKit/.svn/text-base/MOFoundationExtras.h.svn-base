 @header MOFoundationExtras
 @discussion This is a collection of categories on Foundation objects.  It has become a time honored tradition for any framework to have categories which add various useful non-primitive methods to Foundation.  Well, who is MOKit to buck this tradition?  Of course, for maximum utility, such non-primitive methods should always be implemented in terms of the primitives for the class.  Especially if it is a class cluster.  (This is generally the natural way to implement them anyway.)
