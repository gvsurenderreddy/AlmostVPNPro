 @class MOExtendedTableView
 @abstract MOExtendedTableView adds a number of new features to the standard NSTableView.
 @discussion MOExtendedTableView adds a number of new features to the standard NSTableView.  There are a few simple additional features such as being able to alter the way editing ends, setting a minimum row height, a convenience method for changing the font of the whole table, and support for per-cell context menus.

 MOExtendedTableView also adds a number of new, optional, dataSource and delegate methods.  It defines dataSource API for user-initiated row creation and deletion with accompanying action methods to wire controls to.  It defines delegate API to allow the delegate to easily handle return or delete key presses in the table.  It adds delegate API to provide, replace or alter a table's context menu.  And, there's dataSource API that unifies handling of pasteboard contents for drag&drop, copy/paste, and Services.

If the cell has no menu or if the click was not over a cell, then super is called (which will return any menu set on the table with the -setMenu: or wired to the menu outlet of the table in IB).  Finally, if the delegate implements -tableView:willReturnMenu:forTableColumn:row:event:, that message is sent (passing the menu we found, or nil if no menu was found.)

 @method tableView:readRowsFromPasteboard:row:dropOperation:pasteboardSourceType:
 @abstract Consolidated method for handling reading rows from a pasteboard.
 @discussion This method provides a single funnel point for reading rows from the pasteboard for drag&frop, copy/paste, and Services.  It is sent by the tables' -paste: and -readSelectionFromPasteboard: methods.  It is also sent from MOKit's delfault NSObject implementation of the standard NSTableView drag&drop dataSource method -tableView:acceptDrop:row:dropOperation:.  An implementation should read the data from the pasteboard and insert new rows (usually).

 In case the exact semantics for handling the different kinds of operations is required, an enumeration constant is passed in that identifies why the method is being called (ie whether it is for copy/paste or drag&drop or Services.)  For drag&drop the constant also tells you whether the source of the new rows is the same table that is receiving them or some other source.

 For copy/paste and Services, the row index will be after the last selected row and the drop operation will be NSTableViewDropAbove.  In some circumstances for copy/paste or for Services, especially, you may want to ignore the row and op parameters and work directly from the selection.  For instance, if a Service took row data as input from the selected rows, you may want to replace the selected rows with the output data.  Note that for Services to be enabled, someone must call NSApplication's -registerServicesMenuSendTypes:returnTypes: with arrays of the supported send and return types to make the application globally aware that these types are supported.

 For drag&drop, you can use the information about whether the source was the same table to decide whether to move or copy the rows by default.  Note also that to accept drops, someone must register the table for the drop types it supports by sending the table a -registerForDraggedTypes: message.
 @param sender The sending MOExtendedTableView.
 @param pboard The pasteboard to read the data from.
 @param row The row index of where to insert the new rows.
