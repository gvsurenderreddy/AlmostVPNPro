// This is a couple silly little macros that allow for quick and dirty indented method trace logs.  It is mostly useful during class development and a more real mechanism might be nice at some point...

// A good way to use this is to put something like:
//    METHOD_TRACE_IN(@"Debug: %s (%@)", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, [self MO_shortDescription]);
// as the very first line of your method and:
//    METHOD_TRACE_OUT;
// as the last line (except the return statement).
// If the method has multiple returns the METHOD_TRACE_OUT should go before each one.  The form of the METHOD_TRACE_IN will print a nicely formatted indication of what method is indicating including the class that implements the method.  The second part will print the receiver's description which generally includes the class of the
