 @class MOFileCompletionStrategy
 @abstract Implements path completion.
 @discussion MOFileCompletionStrategy implements straight-forward path completion. This class uses the basePath to provide a base to use when interpretting relative paths. There are several options to control the completion behavior including whether to append a "/" after directory completions and whether to append a space after filename completions.

 @method matchesForPrefixString:newPrefixString:basePath:
 @abstract Returns potential completions for a prefix path.
 @discussion This method first splits the prefix string into two pieces.  The first is the prefix up to the last path separator character and the second is the last (partial) path component. Then, the first part (the directory path) and the base path are passed to -basePathFromProposedBasePath:path: to find the effective basePath to use. Then, the effective basePath is prepended to the directory path and the result, along with the partial last path component are passed to -addFilesMatchingPrefix:forChildrenOfDirectory:toMutableArray: to generate the actual matches.  Finally, the new prefix string (the directory path) is assigned to *newStr.
 @param str The prefix string (path) that completions should be done against.
 @param newStr MOFileCompletionStrategy changes the prefix to remove the last partial path component.  Then the results array is returned containing full path components.
 @param basePath MOFileCompletionStrategy uses this as a path that serves as the base for evaluating relative paths.
 @result An array of path components starting with the given prefix path.

 @method fullStringForPrefixString:completionString:isInitialPrefixMatch:basePath:
 @abstract Method for composing a prefix path and a completion.
 @discussion MOFileCompletionStrategy overrides this method to append the prefix and completion together as path components.  Also, if initialPrefixMatch is NO then the appendsSpaceOnFileMatch or appendsSlashOnDirectoryMatch setting is taken into account and a space or slash is added if needed.
 @param prefixStr The prefix string (directory path).
 @param completionStr The completion string (last path component).
 @param initialPrefixMatch If this is NO, then the appendsSpaceOnFileMatch or appendsSlashOnDirectoryMatch settings are taken into account and a space or slash may be appended to the resulting full string.
 @param basePath MOFileCompletionStrategy uses this as a path that serves as the base for evaluating relative paths.
 @result The composed completion which will be inserted into the NSTextView in place of the prefix.
