 @function MOLog
 @abstract Like NSLog but does not output process and timestamp info.
 @discussion Often when doing debug output, the extra prefix info that NSLog includes out just clutters the output and makes it harder to read and harder to format reasonably.  On the other hand, printf does not support the %@ escape to include strings and other Obj-C objects' descriptions in the output.  MOLog is a varargs function like NSLog that supports the %@ escape (and all other +[NSString stringWithFormat:] features).  No prefix information (like process info and timestamps) will be printed.  If the formatted output does not end with a newline, a newline will be added.
 @param formatString The format string for the log output.
 @param ... additional arguments that supply values required by the escape sequences in formatString.

It returns a description string like "<Classname: 0xAddress>" just like NSObject's -description method.  You can use it when logging debug output where you know you want a short description in the above form and not whatever extra information a class may decide to include in its -description string.

// This is a couple silly little macros that allow for quick and dirty indented method trace logs.  It is mostly useful during class development and a more real mechanism might be nice at some point...

// A good way to use this is to put something like:
//    METHOD_TRACE_IN(@"Debug: %s (%@)", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__, [self MO_shortDescription]);
// as the very first line of your method and:
//    METHOD_TRACE_OUT;
// as the last line (except the return statement).
// If the method has multiple returns the METHOD_TRACE_OUT should go before each one.  The form of the METHOD_TRACE_IN will print a nicely formatted indication of what method is indicating including the class that implements the method.  The second part will print the receiver's description which generally includes the class of the
