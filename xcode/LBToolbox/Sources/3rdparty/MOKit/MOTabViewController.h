 @abstract A view controller that manages an NSTabView.
 @discussion MOTabViewController is a subclass of MOViewController that manages an NSTabView.  Each of its subcontrollers is a tab in the tab view.  MOTabViewController manages swapping the views as the selected tab changes and ensures that a subcontroller's view is loaded only when it is about to be installed as the selected tab item view.
