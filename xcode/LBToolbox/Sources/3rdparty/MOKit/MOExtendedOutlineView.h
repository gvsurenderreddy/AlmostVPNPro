 @class MOExtendedOutlineView
 @abstract MOExtendedOutlineView adds a number of new features to the standard NSOutlineView.
 @discussion MOExtendedOutlineView adds a number of new features to the standard NSOutlineView.  There are a few simple additional features such as being able to alter the way editing ends, setting a minimum row height, a convenience method for changing the font of the whole outline, and support for per-cell context menus.

 MOExtendedOutlineView also adds a number of new, optional, dataSource and delegate methods.  It defines dataSource API for user-initiated item creation and deletion with accompanying action methods to wire controls to.  It defines delegate API to allow the delegate to easily handle return or delete key presses in the outline.  It adds delegate API to provide, replace or alter a outline's context menu.  And, there's dataSource API that unifies handling of pasteboard contents for drag&drop, copy/paste, and Services.

 If the font setting will ultimately be based on a user preference, and there is other content than text in your outlines, it is probably a good idea to set a minimum row height for the outline that will accomodate the non-text content.  (Don't forget the disclosure triangles...)

 This method can be useful if the control over the row-height is somehow in the user's hands andd you want to set a lower limit.  For example, if the font of the outline will be a user preference but there is also non-textual content that requires a minimum row height.

If the cell has no menu or if the click was not over a cell, then super is called (which will return any menu set on the outline with the -setMenu: or wired to the menu outlet of the outline in IB).  Finally, if the delegate implements -outlineView:willReturnMenu:forTableColumn:item:event:, that message is sent (passing the menu we found, or nil if no menu was found.)

 @method outlineView:readItemsFromPasteboard:item:childIndex:pasteboardSourceType:
 @abstract Consolidated method for handling reading rows from a pasteboard.
 @discussion This method provides a single funnel point for reading items from the pasteboard for drag&frop, copy/paste, and Services.  It is sent by the outlines' -paste: and -readSelectionFromPasteboard: methods.  It is also sent from MOKit's delfault NSObject implementation of the standard NSOutlineView drag&drop dataSource method -outlineView:acceptDrop:item:childIndex:.  An implementation should read the data from the pasteboard and insert new items (usually).

 In case the exact semantics for handling the different kinds of operations is required, an enumeration constant is passed in that identifies why the method is being called (ie whether it is for copy/paste or drag&drop or Services.)  For drag&drop the constant also tells you whether the source of the new rows is the same outline that is receiving them or some other source.

 For copy/paste and Services, the child index and item will be computed so that the new rows will be inserted as siblings after the last selected item.  In some circumstances for copy/paste or for Services, especially, you may want to ignore the childIndex and item parameters and work directly from the selection.  For instance, if a Service took row data as input from the selected rows, you may want to replace the selected rows with the output data.  Note that for Services to be enabled, someone must call NSApplication's -registerServicesMenuSendTypes:returnTypes: with arrays of the supported send and return types to make the application globally aware that these types are supported.

 For drag&drop, you can use the information about whether the source was the same outline to decide whether to move or copy the rows by default.  Note also that to accept drops, someone must register the outline for the drop types it supports by sending the outline a -registerForDraggedTypes: message.
 @param sender The sending MOExtendedOutlineView.
 @param pboard The pasteboard to read the data from.
 @param childIndex The child index of where to insert the new items within the given parent item.  May be NSOutlineViewDropOnItemIndex if the drop is "onto" an item instead of between two items.
