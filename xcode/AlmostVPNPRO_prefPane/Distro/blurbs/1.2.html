<li>
Better handling of tunnels to "intermittent" services. AlmostVPN used to terminate tunnel after first failure to connect. Not any more.
</li>
<li>
AlmostVPN now can control systemwide SOCKS proxy settings. It can turn it ON when SOCKS proxy provided by AlmostVPN is ON and turn it OFF when the proxy is OFF.
</li>
<li>
AlmostVPN supports OTP (One Time Password) and can deal with "unexpected" requests from SSH servers.
</li>
<li>
Experimental support for UDP tunneling (work in progress. milage may vary).
