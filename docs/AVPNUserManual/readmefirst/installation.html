<h1>Installation Instructions for AlmostVPN</h1>

<h2>Preference Pane Installation</h2>

There are two ways to install a Preference Pane:<br>

<ul>

  <li>double-click it, in the finder,</li>

  <li>copy it into /Library/PreferencePanes or
&nbsp;~/Library/PreferencePanes</li>

</ul>

You can use either of these ways to install AlmostVPN Preference Pane.
&nbsp;Unlike 0.9.x version, which must be installed "For this User
only" (~/Library/PreferencePanes), version 1.0 (as of GA) could be
installed "For All Users" (/Library/PreferencePanes) as well as "For
This User". &nbsp;<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

NOTE:</span> Though it is possible to install AlmostVPN "For All
Users", as of now it is still "single-user" application. &nbsp;Only
one
user on particular host can use AlmostVPN.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

NOTE:</span> As of "GA", AlmostVPN 1.0 will coexist peacefully
with
0.9.x. &nbsp;You do not have to un-install 0.9.x version before you
install 1.0.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> When
installed using
"double-click", &nbsp;it is advisable to re-start System
Preferences
right after AlmostVPN has been installed. &nbsp;<br>

</div>

<h2>&nbsp;AlmostVPN Menu Bar Installation</h2>

AlmostVPN Menu Bar application packaged inside of AlmostVPN Preference
Pane. &nbsp;To install (and start it), go to "Preferences/General"
tab
and select "Menu Bar App: start at login" option. &nbsp;Once
checked,
it will install Menu Bar App as a "login item" to make it start
automatically on each login. <br>
