<h1>Note to 0.9.x Users</h1>

<br>

As you may already noticed, 1.0 is VERY DIFFERENT from 0.9.x.
&nbsp;I
do believe that after a while, you will find it easier to use than
0.9.x. But judging by some people reaction on 1.0, having been "0.9
junkie", &nbsp;might be a disadvantage. 1.0 can do a lot of very
smart
things which 0.9.x have not even dreamed about, but at the same
time,&nbsp;1.0 does even most simple things differently compare to
0.9.x. &nbsp;Please read next chapter (<a href="bigidea.html">Big
Idea</a>) it will help you to adjust to the brave new world of
AlmostVPN 1.0. &nbsp;<br>
