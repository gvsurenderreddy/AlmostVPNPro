      <p>This section contains general questions about SLF4J.</p>
    
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="1.1">1.1 What is SLF4J?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>SLF4J is a simple facade for logging systems allowing the
        end-user to plug-in the desired logging system at deployment
        time.
        </p>
      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="1.2">1.2 When should SLF4J be used?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>In short, libraries and other embedded components should
        consider SLF4J for their logging needs because libraries
        cannot afford to impose their choice of logging system on the
        end-user. On the other hand, it does not necessarily make
        sense for stand-alone applications to use SLF4J. Stand-alone
        applications can invoke the logging system of their choice
        directly.
        </p>

        <p>SLF4J is only a facade, meaning that it does not provide a
        complete logging solution. Operations such as configuring
        appenders or setting logging levels cannot be performed with
        SLF4J. Thus, at same point in time, any non-trivial
        application will need to directly invoke the underlying
        logging system. In other words, complete independence from the
        API underlying logging system is not possible for a
        stand-alone application. Nevertheless, SLF4J reduces the
        impact of this dependence to near-painless levels.
        </p>

        <p>Suppose that your CRM application uses log4j for its
        logging. However, one of your important clients request that
        logging be performed through JDK 1.4 logging. If your
        application is riddled with thousands of direct log4j calls,
        migration to JDK 1.4 would be a long and error-prone
        process. Had you been invoking SLF4J API instead of log4j, the
        migration could be completed in a matter of minutes instead of
        hours.
        </p>

        <p>SLF4J lets component developers to defer the choice of the
        logging system to the end-user but eventually a choice needs
        to be made.
        </p>

             <a name="1.3">1.3 Is SLF4J yet another logging facade?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>SLF4J is conceptually similar to JCL. As such, it can be
        thought of as yet another logging facade. However, SLF4J is
        orders of magnitude simpler in design and arguably more
        robust.
        </p>

      instead of creating a new project?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>This is a very good question. First, SLF4J static binding
        approach is very simple, perhaps even laughably so. It was not
        easy to convince developers of the validity of the
        approach. It is only after SLF4J was released and started to
        become accepted did the approach gain respectability in the
        relevant community.
        </p>

        <p>Second, SLF4J offers two enhancements which developers
        currently tend to underestimate. Parameterized log messages
        solve an important problem associated with logging performance
        in a pragmatic way. Marker objects, which are supported by the
        <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface, pave the way for
        adoption of advanced logging systems and still leave the door
        open to switching back to more traditional logging systems if
        need be.

           </div>
                      
        No, you do not need to recompile your application. You can

        SLF4J binding and replacing it with the binding of your
        choice.

        <em>slf4j-nop.jar</em> with <em>slf4j-log4j12.jar</em> on your
        class path but do not forget to add log4j-1.2.x.jar as
        well. Want to switch to JDK 1.4 logging?  Just replace

      </div>
                                       
      <p>This section contains questions about the SLF4J API, in
      particular the Logger interface.</p>
    
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="2.1">2.1 Why don't the printing methods in the Logger interface
      accept message of type Object, but only messages of type
      String?</a>
           </div>
                      

        <p>In SLF4J 1.0beta4, the printing methods such as debug(),
        info(), warn(), error() in the <a href="api/org/slf4j/Logger.html">Logger interface</a> were
        modified so as to accept only messages of type String instead
        of Object.
        </p>

        <p>Thus, the set of printing methods for the DEBUG level
        became:</p>
        <p class="source">debug(String msg); 
debug(String format, Object arg); 
debug(String format, Object arg1, Object arg2);           
debug(String msg, Throwable t); </p>

        <p>Previously, the first argument in the above methods was of
        type <code>Object</code>.</p>

        <p>This change enforces the notion that logging systems are
        about decorating and handling messages of type String, and not
        any arbitrary type (Object).
        </p>

        <p>Just as importantly, the new set of method signatures offer
        a clearer differentiation between the overladed methods
        whereas previously the choice of the invoked method due to
        Java overloding rules were not always easy to follow.</p>

        <p>It was also easy to make mistakes. For example, previously
        it was legal to write:</p>

        <p class="source">logger.debug(new Exception("some error"));</p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately, the above call did not print the stack trace
        of the exception. Thus, a potentially crucial piece of
        information could be lost. When the first parameter is
        restricted to be of type String, then only the method
        </p>
        <p class="source">debug(String msg, Throwable t) </p>
        
        <p>can be used to log exceptions. Note that this method
        ensures that every logged exception is accompanied with a
        descriptive message.</p>
      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="2.2">2.2 Can I log an exception without an accompanying message?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>In short, no.</p>

        <p>If <code>e</code> is an <code>Exception</code>, and you
        would like to log an exception at the ERROR level, you must
        add an accompanying message. For example,</p>

        <p class="source">logger.error("some accompanying message", e);</p>

        <p>You might correctly observe that not all exceptions have a
        meaningful message to accompany them. Moreover, a good
        exception should already contain a self explanatory
        description. The accompanying message may therefore be
        considered redundant.
        </p>


        <p>While these are valid arguments, there are three opposing
        arguments also worth considering. First, on many, albeit not
        all occasions, the accompanying message can convey useful
        information nicely complementing the description contained in
        the exception. Frequently, at the point where the exception is
        logged, the developer has access to more contextual
        information than at the point where the exception is
        thrown. Second, it is not difficult to imagine more or less
        generic messages, e.g. "Exception caught", "Exception
        follows", that can be used as the first argument for
        <code>error(String msg, Throwable t)</code> invocations.
        Third, most log output formats display the message on a line,
        followed by the exception on a separate line. Thus, the
        message line would look inconsistent without a message.
        </p>

        <p>In short, if the user were allowed to log an exception
        without an accompanying message, it would be the job of the
        logging system to invent a message. This is actually what the
        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cr9kg">throwing(String
        sourceClass, String sourceMethod, Throwable thrown)</a> method
        in java.util.logging package does. (It decides on its own that
        accompanying message is the string "THROW".)
        </p>
        
        <p>It may initially appear strange to require an accompanying
        message to log an exception. Nevertheless, this is common
        practice in <em>all</em> log4j derived systems such as
        java.util.logging, logkit, etc. and of course log4j itself. It
        seems that the current consensus considers requiring an
        accompanying message as a good a thing (TM).
        </p>

      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="2.3">2.3 What is the fastest way of (not) logging?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p> For some Logger <code>logger</code>, writing, </p>
        <p class="source">logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));</p>
        
        <p>incurs the cost of constructing the message parameter, that
        is converting both integer <code>i</code> and
        <code>entry[i]</code> to a String, and concatenating
        intermediate strings. This, regardless of whether the message
        will be logged or not.
        </p>
        


        <p>One possible way to avoid the cost of parameter
        construction is by surrounding the log statement with a
        test. Here is an example.</p>

        <p class="source">if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
  logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
} </p>


        <p>
          This way you will not incur the cost of parameter
          construction if debugging is disabled for
          <code>logger</code>. On the other hand, if the logger is
          enabled for the DEBUG level, you will incur the cost of
          evaluating whether the logger is enabled or not, twice: once
          in <code>debugEnabled</code> and once in <code>debug</code>.
          This is an insignificant overhead because evaluating a
          logger takes less than 1% of the time it takes to actually
          log a statement.
        </p>

	

        <p><b>Better alternative based on format messages</b></p>
        
        <p>There exists a very convenient alternative based on message
        formats. Assuming <code>entry</code> is an object, you can write:
        </p>
        
        
        <p class="source">Object entry = new SomeObject();
logger.debug("The entry is {}.", entry); </p>
        
        <p>After evaluting whether to log or not, and only if the
        decision is affirmative, will the logger implementation format
        the message and replace the '{}' pair with the string value of
        <code>entry</code>. In other words, tis form does not incur
        the cost of parameter construction in case the log statement
        is disabled.
        </p>
        
        <p>The following two lines will yield the exact same
        output. However, the second form will outperform the first
        form by a factor of at least 30, in case of a
        <em>disabled</em> logging statement.
        </p>
        
        <p class="source">logger.debug("The new entry is "+entry+".");
logger.debug("The new entry is {}.", entry); </p>
   
   
        <p>A two argument variant is also availalble. For example, you can
        write: </p>
        
        <p class="source">logger.debug("The new entry is {}. It replaces {}.", entry, oldEntry);</p>

        <p>If three or more arguments need to be passed, an
        <code>Object[]</code> variant is also availalble. For example,
        you can write: </p>
        
        <p class="source">logger.debug("Value {} was inserted between {} and {}.", 
             new Object[] {newVal, below, above});</p>
        

        
      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="2.4">2.4 How can I log the string contents of a single (possibly
      complex) object?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>
        In relatively rare cases where the message to be logged is the
        string form of an object, then the parameterized printing
        method of the appropriate level can be used. Assuming
        <code>complexObject</code> is an object of certain complexity,
        for a log statement of level DEBUG, you can write:
        </p>

        <p class="source">logger.debug("{}", complexObject);</p>


        <p>The logging system will invoke
        <code>complexObject.toString()</code> method only after it has
        ascertained that the log statement was enabled. Otherwise, the
        cost of <code>complexObject.toString()</code> conversion will
        be advantageously avoided.
        </p>

      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="2.5">2.5 Why doesn't the <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface
      have methods for the FATAL level?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>From the stand point of a logging system, the distinction
        between a fatal error and an error is usually not very
        useful. Most programmers exit the application when a fatal
        error is encountered. However, a logging library cannot (and
        should not) decide on its own to terminate an application. The
        initiative to exit the application must be left to the
        developer.
        </p>


        <p>Thus, the most the FATAL level can do is to
        <em>highlight</em> a given error as the cause for application
        to crash. However, errors are by definition exceptional events
        that merit attention. If a given situation causes errors to be
        logged, the causes should be attended to as soon as
        possible. However, if the "error" is actually a normal
        situation which cannot be prevented but merits being aware of,
        then it should be marked as WARN, not ERROR.
        </p>
        
        <p>Assuming the ERROR level designates exceptional situations
        meriting close attention, we are inclined to believe that the
        FATAL level is superfluous.

             <a name="2.6">2.6 Why doesn't the <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> interface
      have methods for the TRACE level?</a>
           </div>
                      

        <p>The addition of the TRACE level has been frequently and
        hotly debated request. By studying various projects, it looks
        like the TRACE level is mostly used to disable logging output
        from certain classes without needing to configure logging for
        those classes. Indeed, the TRACE level is by default disabled
        in log4j and other logging systems. We believe that the same
        result could be achieved by adding the appropriate directives
        in configuration files.
        </p>

        <p>Thus, in the majority of cases the TRACE level has the same
        semantic meaning as DEBUG. In such case, the TRACE level
        merely saves a few configuration directives. In the rare but
        interesting cases where TRACE has a different meaning than
        DEBUG, <a href="api/org/slf4j/Marker.html">Marker</a> objects
        can be put to use to convey the desired new meaning.

       <p>NLOG4J is a drop-in replacement for log4j. In particular, code
       previously compiled with log4j will run fine with NLOG4J. The
       same will also compile fine against NLOG4J (without any
       changes). However, due to signature changes in some important
       logging methods, compilation against NLOG4J is sticky. Software
       compiled against NLOG4J will require NLOG4J to run. </p>
       
       <p>Thus, you can easily switch from log4j to NLOG4J but you
       cannot switch back without first recompiling your code with
       log4j.
       </p>
       
       <p>At this stage, we should emphasize that if you code against
       the SLF4J API, the question of compiling against log4j or
       NLOG4J is not relevant. As far as your code is concerned, the
       java compiler only sees the SLF4J API, not log4j or
       NLOG4J.

      </div>
                                       
      <p>This section contains questions asked by developers of
      logging systems wishing to conform with SLF4J.</p>
    
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="3.1">3.1 How do I make my logging framework SLF4J
      compatible?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>We suggest that the <code>Logger</code> class in your
        framework directly implement the <a href="api/org/slf4j/Logger.html"><code>org.slf4j.Logger</code></a>
        interface.
        </p>

        <p>We further recommend that your framework copy the SLF4J
        java source files (.java files) into your source tree. This
        can be accomplished by checking out SLF4J files from its
        source code repository using Subversion, more on this later.
        </p>

        <p>Client code will only refer to <a href="api/org/slf4j/LoggerFactory.html">LoggerFactory</a> to
        retreive org.slf4j.Logger instances, your framework needs to
        instruct <code>LoggerFactory</code> to return your framework's
        <code>Logger</code> instances. This step is usually reffered
        to as binding SLF4J with your framework. In recent versions of
        SLF4J, the binding information has been isolated into a small
        class named <a href="api/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.html">StaticLoggerBinder</a>.
        </p>

     
        <p>With the static binding approach we recommend, your
        framework's copy of <code>StaticBinder</code> class needs to
        be customized before compile time. You should be able to
        easily adapt NLOG4J's copy of <a href="http://svn.slf4j.org/viewcvs/nlog4j/trunk/src/java/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.java?view=markup">StaticLoggerBinder.java</a>
        to your framework. Note that you do not need to change any
        other classes to ensure correct binding.
        </p>


       <p>Just as importantly, adapting SLF4J to your system can be an
       entirely automated process. Thus, when there are small changes
       to the SLF4J API, you can update to the latest SLF4J version
       without needing to edit any java files. For example, NLOG4J
       uses an entirely automated build procedure to synchronize with
       SLF4J changes.
       </p>

       <p>For a complete example of an automated build file, please
       refer to the <a href="http://svn.slf4j.org/viewcvs/nlog4j/trunk/slf4j.xml?view=markup">slf4j.xml</a>
       build file in the NLOG4J project.
       </p>
      
                                 <div class="question">
             <a name="3.2">3.2 How can my logging system add support for
      the <code>Marker</code> interface?</a>
           </div>
                      
        <p>Markers consitute a revolutionary concept which is
        supported by LOGBack but not other existing logging
        systems. Consequently, SLF4J confromant logging systems are
        allowed to ignore marker data passed by the user.
        </p>

        <p>However, even though marker data may be ignored, the user
        must still be allowed to specify marker data. Otherwise, users
        would not be able to switch between logging systems that
        support markers and those that do not.  In order to provide
        minimal support for markers, SLF4J conformant systems need to
        to include certain Marker related classes, namely,
        <code>org.slf4j.Marker</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.IMarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.MarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.BasicMarker</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.BasicMarkerFactory</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.MarkerIgnoringBase</code>,
        <code>org.slf4j.impl.StaticMarkerBinder</code> and
        <code>org.slf4j.spi.MarkerFactoryBinder</code>. Al of these
        classes are availalbe in the SLF4J subversion repository.
        </p>

        <p>The <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code> class can serve as a
        base for adapters or native implementations of logging systems
        lacking marker support. In <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code>,
        methods taking marker data simply invoke the corresponding
        method without the Marker argument, discarding any Marker data
        passed as argument. Your SLF4J adapters can extend
        <code>MarkerIgnoringBase</code> to quickly implement the
        methods in <code>org.slf4j.Logger</code> which take a
        <code>Marker</code> as the first argument.
        </p>
